# Day 4: Complete Travel Planning System

This final tutorial brings together all the concepts from previous days to build a complete travel planning system using CrewAI.

## System Overview

The travel planning system uses multiple AI agents working together to:
1. Research travel conditions
2. Calculate budgets
3. Create personalized itineraries
4. Provide comprehensive travel recommendations

## Files

- `enhanced_main.py`: Main travel planning system
- `tools.py`: Custom tools for travel planning

## Features

1. Multi-Agent System
   - Research Analyst for gathering information
   - Travel Advisor for creating recommendations
   - Tool-enabled agents for specific tasks

2. Custom Tools
   - Date/time operations
   - Weather information
   - Budget calculations

3. Advanced Features
   - Error handling
   - Environment validation
   - Structured output
   - Agent coordination

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Days 1-3
- Gemini API key
- Understanding of CrewAI concepts
- Python 3.8+

## Setup

1. Ensure you have completed the previous tutorials
2. Configure your environment:
```bash

```

## Running the System

```bash
python enhanced_main.py
```

The system will:
1. Research travel conditions
2. Calculate trip budgets
3. Generate a detailed itinerary
4. Provide recommendations

## Code Structure

The system demonstrates:
- Professional code organization
- Proper error handling
- Environment validation
- Tool integration
- Multi-agent coordination

## Expected Output

The system produces:
- Detailed travel research
- Budget calculations
- 3-day itinerary
- Travel recommendations

## Customization

You can customize:
- Destination cities
- Budget parameters
- Trip duration
- Agent configurations
- Tool implementations

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial series, you can:
1. Add more specialized agents
2. Implement additional tools
3. Enhance error handling
4. Add new features
5. Deploy the system
